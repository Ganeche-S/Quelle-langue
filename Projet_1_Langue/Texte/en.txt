The 2nd Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army, first formed in 1809 for service in the Peninsular War. The second formation fought at the Battle of Waterloo and played an important role in defeating the final French attack. It was disbanded in December 1818. During the mid to late 19th century, several formations bearing the name 2nd Division were formed, including in 1854 to take part in the Crimean War and in 1899 for the Second Boer War. From 1902 the division was based at Aldershot, in southern England. When World War I broke out in 1914, it was deployed to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. It served on the Western Front and suffered heavy casualties. The division returned to Aldershot for the interwar period. During World War II, the formation was deployed to France again, evacuated from Dunkirk, and served in Burma. In the post-war years it formed part of the British Army of the Rhine in Germany. The division was most recently disbanded in 2012.
